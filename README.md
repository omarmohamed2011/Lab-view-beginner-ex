What Is LabVIEW?

LabVIEW is systems engineering software for applications that require test, measurement, and control with rapid access to hardware and data insights.

LabVIEW offers a graphical programming approach that helps you visualize every aspect of your application, including hardware configuration, measurement data, and debugging. This visualization makes it simple to integrate measurement hardware from any vendor, represent complex logic on the diagram, develop data analysis algorithms, and design custom engineering user interfaces.
